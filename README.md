# Assembly
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that serves as a bridge between machine code (binary instructions executed by a computer's CPU) and high-level programming languages like C or Python. It provides a more human-readable way to write programs by using symbolic names for operations, memory locations, and registers.

Key Features of Assembly Language:
Mnemonics:

Instructions are represented by short, easy-to-remember names called mnemonics (e.g., MOV, ADD, SUB, JMP).
These correspond directly to machine instructions.
Registers:

Assembly provides access to CPU registers, which are small storage locations within the processor used for fast data manipulation.
Platform Specific:

Each type of CPU (Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, etc.) has its own assembly language because it directly reflects the architecture's instruction set.
Symbolic Representation:

Instead of numeric addresses, assembly allows the use of symbolic labels to refer to memory locations, making code easier to read.
Control Over Hardware:

Assembly gives programmers direct control over hardware resources, making it suitable for tasks requiring high performance or low-level operations, like device drivers or embedded systems.
Advantages of Assembly:
Efficiency: Programs can be optimized for performance and memory usage.
Control: Allows direct interaction with hardware.
Minimal Overhead: Removes the abstraction layers of high-level languages.
Disadvantages of Assembly:
Complexity: Writing and debugging assembly code is more difficult and time-consuming.
Portability: Assembly code written for one CPU architecture won't work on another without modification.
Verbosity: Even simple tasks require many lines of code compared to high-level languages.
